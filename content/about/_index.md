## Sumita is a multidisciplinary technologist based in Portland, OR.

I am an Experience Designer with a ten year background as a front-end developer. I live at the intersection of design and technology and work to create meaningful experiences that surprise and delight users.

In my spare time you can find me writing, cooking while listening to podcasts, and watching any reality TV the Bravo network has to offer. I'm not kidding, I gave my first technical talk about [how reality TV inspired me to learn UX](/personal-site/work/creative/#speaking-engagements). My final form will be achieved when the people I hold near and dear finally heed my pleas to watch Real Housewives so we can embark on a journey of laughs together.

I am currently freelancing. Please feel free to reach out via email about speaking engagements, experience design, development, or anything based on my interests!
