# The Wild Zoo
### A graduate prototyping project for Drexel University's CCI Master's Program

### Product Description
The Wild Zoo mobile application is ideally designed to allow parents to easily schedule and purchase online tickets for exhibits, events, and other fun activities with the family. In addition, it provides easy access to admission information, parking availability, and resources for trip planning. Integrated features such as QR codes for simple access to the Zoo, imagery support, color enhancements, font clarity, and button visibility to allow a healthy user experience.

Parents face many challenges and responsibilities in their everyday lives. Planning a family event is another task a family member will face and seek help for when in need of guidance. Parents want to enjoy a stress-free day with the kids, but hard-to-find parking, difficulties finding the service booth, and long wait lines at the entry gates can get in the way. Parents may have experienced other problems with online activity planning in the past, such as:

* Difficulty in finding information quickly
* The font size of the application is too small to read
* The color combination presents the content as too bright or too dark
* No imagery support of the location's site
* Action buttons are small-scale for parent users to click comfortably on smartphone screens 
* Not having access to print tickets

These obstacles may cause parents to experience headaches, stress, anxiety, confusion, and frustration. To empathize with parent users, we gathered these concepts to understand the problem better and to find solutions for a more enjoyable user experience design. 

To minimize these negative symptoms, we established an application system to address these hurdles and reprogram the system with features we believe will anticipate and avoid users' problems. For example, users will access information faster due to well-researched content design, categorizing these questions with answers and links to reduce the number of clicks. The design team focused on content quality, increasing the visibility and color contrast to allow comfort to the eyes. Imagery support enables users to gather memory to locate the destination with verification in mind. The application clarifies how users' can acquire tickets for admission, exhibits, and events to the Zoo. At the end of online ticket purchase to the Zoo, users are granted with OR codes, removing the need to print and reduce the wait times in long lines.

### Methodology
The design process began by addressing who the user is and what obstacles they face when planning a trip to the Zoo. The team brainstormed by gathering ideas and thoughts of our users. We used Stormboard, an online collaborative workspace tool. This tool gave us the space to figure out aspects of the user, such as our ideal user, empathizing with the user, and defining the challenges and obstacles they encounter. We decided to focus on families and empathize with the experience of trip planning for parents of small children. They would want a stress-free experience and easy interactions. It also gave us ideas to include in the functionality, such as big buttons to make multi-tasking easy.

After agreeing we would focus on the parent user, we moved on to the next phase. We used Miro to create a flowchart to map out the steps needed to complete an online ticket purchase in conjunction with browsing exhibits and events. Miro helped us figure out the granularity of the checkout process so that we knew how many wireframes we needed and the purpose of each of them. We used the flowchart to divide wireframing tasks between team members and produced wireframes that would allow the user to complete an online purchase.

We then created mid-fidelity wireframes using Figma, a collaborative prototyping tool. This facilitated a discussion of the interactions the user would need available, and affirmed that our solution was viable. The next part of the design process was to do a quick study in receiving feedback from potential users to evaluate our designs and refine our concepts to fit the needs of our users.

The final stage was to make adjustments based on feedback and bring our wireframes to high fidelity. We implemented a color palette based on material design that would create the upbeat look and feel we wanted to convey for the zoo. Our imagery and color palette were chosen to complement and support the content and resources users are seeking online.

### Functional Prototype

We worked together in Figma to create a functional prototype of The Wild Zoo app. The prototype can be viewed [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/YhC0efNcgR7V8f39aHKMpu/INFO-691-Zoo-Prototype?node-id=2%3A3&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1 "Wild Zoo Prototype")

### Feedback

We collected a few points of feedback on our prototype that we were able to implement in a further iteration. Other suggestions we noted as a next step to take beyond the scope of this project. The feedback of our participants on our application was insightful. For example, a mother with two children had suggested in our exhibit page to add a page where she can have the option to either find more information on a particular event or make an online ticket purchase.

One participant noted about the lemur event on the homepage, “It would be good to know more about Tommy to know if I want to get tickets.” Due to this comment, we revised the call to action for that event from “Get tickets” to “Learn more.” This way, users do not feel pressure to commit to a purchase when they click that button. The button leads to a screen which provides details about the event, so this aligns with users’ expectations for a “Learn more” button.

We also received positive feedback about the content. Said one participant, “Cute! All of this feels good for a mom. ‘Nose-to-beak’ is kid-friendly.” According to preliminary testing, we succeeded in creating the upbeat, kid-friendly look and feel that we targeted with our color palette, imagery and verbiage.

See [Appendix A](#appendix-a) for all quotes that were recorded during feedback sessions.

### Next Steps

The Wild Zoo application needs to be tested further in its intended environment and researched to understand users' needs further. By implementing these methods, we would improve the user experience and increase the chance of adoption. Further iterations will  include an interactive zoo map to provide directions based on users' locations, ability to view average wait times for exhibits, events, food courts, and restrooms to eliminate unwelcome surprises.


### Appendix A
#### User Feedback

"I would like to have the option to see more information on a particular exhibit and purchase the ticket as well." - User Tester, Female, 39, Mother of two children

“When I go to that homepage, it encourages me to sign up for the flamingos, but what if I just want to get a general admission for the zoo? I wasn’t sure how to do that when I first got there.” - User Tester, Female, 60, Mother of three children

“It seems like the main reason most people come is to go to the zoo, not to go to a specific exhibit, so that should be really easy.” - User Tester, Female, 60, Mother of three children

“As long as I knew how to go to the zoo, I liked seeing the other options. I’d want to see some of those things and consider them.” - User Tester, Female, 60, Mother of three children

“It would be good to know more about Tommy to know if I want to get tickets.” - User Tester, Female, 60, Mother of three children

“Cute! All of this feels good for a mom. ‘Nose-to-beak’ is kid-friendly.” - User Tester, Female, 60, Mother of three children
