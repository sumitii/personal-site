## Sudarsna Mukund

Concept, design, research and strategy for a professional ballerina who also happens to be my sister! Sudarsna Mukund is a ballerina who has performed everywhere from Detroit to Sofia, Bulgaria. She wanted to create a website that functioned as a digital resum√©.

I conducted several rounds of research, leading to some valuable insights about content strategy and best pracitices when showcasing an artistic skillset online. I created designs that were based on the goals of the client and my research. The final experience is one Sudarsna and I were both thrilled with!
