      <description>TigerSoup When change comes to an industry, marketing people tend to follow their tried and true methods. As the rules of the game change, it is imperative to think outside the box in order to create successful outcomes for clients. Tiger Soup assembles custom remote teams of creative leaders to solve unique marketing challenges that current resources cannot solve either through lack of available time or lack of experience.
Working with the team at Amplified by Design, and Amsterdam-based illustrator Katsiaryna Dubovik I took on the role of both experience designer and web developer.</description>
